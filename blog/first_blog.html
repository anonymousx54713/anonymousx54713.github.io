        <p>
            Today I did a little experiment on humans. I saw a very beautiful lady, I mean very very 
            beautiful...She has a pretty and small face, a toned figure, light skin and a smile that
            might even end world war III. So, I approached her and said that she's pretty like a red
            rose. She blushed and smiled in response and thanked me. The people around us also 
            giggled and complimented her. So, it was a cute interaction right?
        </p>
        <p>
            Then I met a white guy, I mean extremely white that even the British people might
            envy. So I told him, "Hey man, you're so white and handsome! What's the secret of your 
            beauty?". He just casually smiled in response ans told me that both of his parents
            are white so this is just a blessing, there's no secret.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, I met a black and muscular guy. He's so black that I thought he's a walking
            shadow. What? Did you just judge me now and called me a racist? Well, I don't mind. 
            Anyway, I approached him with a smile and said, "Hey man! You're so black and muscular!
            What's the secret of your looks?" This sounds pretty similar to my interaction with the 
            white guy, right? But he got angry and replid, "Ya making fun of me n***a? I'm gonna smash
            your pretty face with this!". So, I told him to chill out and reassured that I'm not making
            fun of him and it was a genuine complement. By this time, some people gathered and of course
            everyone blamed me and told me that I should apologize since I started it. One dude even said that
            I could face legal consequences for being a <b><i>RACIST!?</i></b> So, I just apologized and
            left the scene.
        </p>
        <pre>
    So my question is what is Racism? I can call a pretty lady a rose, I can call a white guy white
    but I am a racist when I call a black guy black?? As you can see, I was not being disrespectful 
    and yet everyone blamed me. So, am I wrong or the world is too sensitive now?
